# [FRISCO] Self-Assessment Questionnaire

The self-assessment questionnaire aims at helping small and medium HSPs understand their level of compliance with the TCO. This questionnaire is meant as a first step for HSPs to understand how their current internal processes for content moderation regarding terrorist content align with the TCO Regulation. The objective of this tool is to provide HSP with a compliance score, which helps them situate themselves in the path to full TCO compliance.

Operational stuff should be able to answer most of the questions in this questionnaire, however involving the legal team of your organisation might be more suitable to avoid back and forth communication for clarifications.

Before you start the questionnaire please advice the definitions for key term in the TCO in the following: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/784/oj

For clarification an HSP according to https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/784/oj is: “‘hosting service provider’ means a provider of services as defined in point (b) of Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/1535/oj), consisting of the storage of information provided by and at the request of a content provider; ‘content provider’ means a user that has provided information that is, or that has been, stored and disseminated to the public by a hosting service provider“

# [FRISCO] Process Map
FRISCO’s process map is an interactive tool that structures and describes the entire compliance process with the TCO Regulation and related duties for HSPs in a holistic way, so to say from the exposure to terrorist content to the transparency reports. This tool, focused on HSPs’ operational needs, provides a precise breakdown of the TCO Regulation, step by step, and is based on a holistic and chronological approach to compliance. The process is displayed gradually, thanks to interactive and/or animated transitions, and the whole map can be downloaded entirely in the end. Legend, colour code and steps increase ergonomics and user’s experience. Finally, more information, resources and tools are made available via the tool.

For clarifications on definitions for key terms in the TCO (e.g., Who qualifies as an HSP? What qualifies as TCO?) please advice the following: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/784/oj
